1. Implemented one-hot-encoding to bring the accuracy of logistic regression to 85%

2. Used random forest to achieve an accuracy of 86%

3. RANDOM FOREST vs. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS
- Based on the Classification reports, we can see that both models performed very similarly. However, based on the confusion matrices, we can see that because the Random forest model had greater precision and accuracy, it is the superior model.
